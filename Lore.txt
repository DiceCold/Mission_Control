lore
 
Planet is Arcturus-3.
Planet population was established by the now defunct company "MaxEdDal Ltd."
Human settlement is spread over a chain of islands.
The company used the colonization as an oppotunity to build hype and promised to build a shining new hub of trade and commerce.
The plans were heavilly misleading or outright fraudulent.
The company ultimately collapsed after a small group of inside traders cashed out on the inflated company valulation.
Went bankrupt and colonists were suddenly left with no support and all infrastructure projects grinding to a halt.
The civil government of Allied Humanity (or United Worlds?) sent humanitarian aid but were already stretched thin and can devote only the bare minimum of resources.
The coproration "Wayne-Powers Industries" has recently turned its attention to the planet now that several years have passed and the risk of total colapse is diminished.
They will fund and equip local warlords to secure the mining rights of a highly radioactive mineral found on the planet.
They have to at least feign legitimacy for legal and PR purposes, but have no hesitation towards creating violence by proxy.
The main city of "Cappernaum" has its own police forces and will ask for support in certain situations.
Usually though they are protective of jurisdiction and resent having their authority infringed upon or undercut.
Moderate degree of corruption among police, whether you accept corrupt pilots is up to you.
Pilots are private contracters and you pay them on a per-day basis depending on whether you use them. 
They need to work a certain number of days to afford cost of living.
They own their own machines, but you have a small budget to pay them bonuses in the form of equipment.
Cost of repairs is split between you and the pilots.
You provide a central residence/office tower/base at the edge of the city but many reside off-site in the downtown or in more rural areas with a lower cost of living.
 
Amount of money staff need to survive monthly = $10
Cost to repair = $1/segment repaired.
Average monthly repairs/pilot = $4

What are the core decisions of the game?
1) How you equip pilots
2) Who you choose to deploy
3) How aggressive/cautious pilots should be
4) Which pilots you prioritize building loyalty with
5) Which pilots you hire/fire
 
Goal is to have the player develop favored pilots and be concerned for their safety while relying on them to do dangerous tasks.

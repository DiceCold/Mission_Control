Nighthawk (Oliverai) is a local who was part of the original colonizaiton effort as a transportation operator.
Holds deep resentment towards anyone who undermines the fragile society or takes advantage of others.
Will act extra-judicially with the expectation that people will look the other way if the target "deserves it"
Wants to punish criminals and bandits for the death of her sister.
Lost her sister during the chaos that occured between the Bankruptcy and the civil government takeover.

Lightbringer (Mickael) acknowledges the tragedy of the chaos that took place after the Bankruptcy, but personally benefited massively from the event.
He worked as private security for the company before the crash and made a small fortune when he switched to defending supply ships from bandits.
Blew much of his money on lavishly upgrading his own personal battlesuit which is his prized possession. 
Likes to be perceived as heroic/tough.

Shadowstalker (Sophia) demonstrated an aptitude for piloting during the frantic civilian recruiting/refurbishment to replace dead pilots.
Consequently was able to have legal charges that were pending at the time of the crash dismissed/swept under the rug.
Self-centered, arrogant, believes in the "survival of the fittest" and will take advantage of any opportunity without hesitation if it benefits her.

Used the family's remaining assets to buy a suit, both for her own protection and to protect others from the same fate.
Unaware that her sister is comatose alive in medical care.

Questing Ricochet (Adam) encountered a dead pilot and assumed their identity as an off-world security contractor.
Things were so disorganized at the time that nobody questioned it, and his experience piloting construction suits was enough for him to handle at least basic movement.

Shadowstalker discovered his secret and uses it to hold power over him.
